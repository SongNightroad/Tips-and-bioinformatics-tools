*pics_of_exons.ipynb* — a script that draws nice pictures, reflecting the position of the reading frame relative to the borders of exons.

*coverage analysis with bedtools.ipynb, bedtools on five genes.bash* — couple of scripts that I used to draw a coverage map of a gene based on a whole-exome-sequencing data (in bam file form). As it is named, I use bedtools and samtools to get coverage data.
